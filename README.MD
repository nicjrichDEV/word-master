## Word Master Project - Frontend Masters Complete Intro to Web Dev V3

This repo contains the work I continue to attempt to do to solve Brian Holts Word Master project without looking at the solution. You can find a demo of the task [here](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/talking-to-servers/project).

In the comming days I will continue to break down the problem a piece at a time and then in the future update it to a custom design created in Figma.
